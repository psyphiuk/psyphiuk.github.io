              Main thing to do initially is to add content to this and other
              pages so that there is something visible to style on each page.
            </p>
            <p>
              While I add the content I am also looking into do general layout
              styling for this page. The aim here is that it should be
              immediately reusable on other pages without modification.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am also exploring what the best way to structure that scss files
              and folders.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because I am using Phi, also known as the golden ratio, as part of
              my developer name, I want to try to incorporate the ratio in as
              many different places as possible. Today I have focused mainly on
              padding and panel proportions.

                The main structure for the scss files has been easier than I
                expected to settle on. I have taken inspiration from
                <a
                  role="link"
                  href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/user-interfaces/building-layouts-preprocessors/7-1-sass-architecture"

                but used helper instead of abstracts and don't have a vendors
                folder as I don't intend to use any 3rd party packages
              </li>
              <li>
                Added some styling for code snippets using a monospace google
                font.
              </li>
              <li>
                I have added a simple, at the moment, colour theme using a
                primary colour picked from one of the images I have downloaded
                from unsplashed and the sass:color built-in package.

              This section includes things that have not gone how I expected.

            <ul role="list">

                I am using a two column <code>aside</code> and
                <code>article</code> structure for this page and had intended to
                use <code>has</code> to determine if an <code>aside</code> is
                present and where it is and then style appropriately. But it
                didn't work on my chrome browser and when I checked is not well
                supported yet. I have used a media query to do this for now but
                at some point need to explore other ways to do it.
                <blockquote>
                  I have settled on a simple <code>display: grid;</code> for
                  this atm.

              </li>
              <li>
                I wanted to improve readability by limiting the width of a
                paragraph to 60ch so that it flows into 2 columns on larger
                screens. This didn't happen in the nice clear way I was
                expecting. Looking at the example on
                <a
                  role="link"
                  href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_column-width.asp"
                  target="."
                  >w3 schools</a
                >
                the <code>column-width</code> is added to a <code>div</code> and
                the text just included directly without a <code>p</code> tag. I
                would like to format it into paragraphs so will need to come up
                with a solution to this.
                <blockquote>
                  <em>Extra Gotcha:</em> Is there are other tags too. This
                  should apply to list items and the blockquotes.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <em>Breakthrough:</em> Not sure what I had done but it is
                  working the way I wanted it to now. It also helps that each
                  section has more text now.
                </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>
                Sticky on the aside, add top with a padding variable and the
                section list stays on the screen. <br />
                <blockquote>
                  <em>Interesting point:</em> The sticky doesn't work on mobile
                  view. It took a while to understand why and how to fix it.
